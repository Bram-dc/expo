Bundle performance varies for different platforms. For example, web browsers don't support precompiled bytecode, so the JavaScript bundle size is important for improving startup time and performance. The smaller the bundle, the faster it can be downloaded and parsed.

## Analyzing bundle size

The libraries used in a project influence the size of the production JavaScript bundle. Starting from **Expo SDK 51**, you can use [Expo Atlas](https://github.com/expo/expo-atlas#readme) to visualize the production bundle and identify which libraries contribute to the bundle size.

### Using Atlas with `expo start`

You can use Expo Atlas with the local development server. This method allows Atlas to update whenever you change any code within your project. 

Once your app is up and running on Android, iOS, and/or web, you can open Atlas through the [dev tools plugin menu](/debugging/devtools-plugins/#using-a-dev-tools-plugin) using <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>m</kbd>.

<Terminal cmd={[
  '# Start the local development server with Atlas',
  '$ EXPO_UNSTABLE_ATLAS=true npx expo start',
  '',
  '# Optionally, run the local development server in production mode',
  '$ EXPO_UNSTABLE_ATLAS=true npx expo start --no-dev', 
]} />

> **Changing development mode to production**
>
> Expo starts in development mode by default. Development mode may turn off optimizations that are enabled in production mode. You can also start the local development server in production mode, which provides a more accurate representation of the production bundle size.

### Using Atlas with `expo export`

You can also use Expo Atlas when generating a production bundle for your app or EAS Update. Atlas generates a **.expo/atlas.jsonl** file during export, which you can share and open without having access to the project.

<Terminal cmd={[
  '# Export your app for all platforms',
  '$ EXPO_UNSTABLE_ATLAS=true npx expo export',
  '',
  '# Open the generated Atlas file',
  '$ npx expo-atlas .expo/atlas.jsonl',
]} />

You can also specify the platforms you want to analyze, using the `--platform` flag. Atlas will gather the data for the exported platforms only.

## Lighthouse

Lighthouse is a great way to see how fast, accessible, and performant your website is. You can test your project with the **Audit** tab in Chrome, or with the [Lighthouse CLI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse#using-the-node-cli).

After creating a production build with `npx expo export -p web` and serving it (using either `npx serve dist`, or production deployment, or custom server), run Lighthouse with the URL your site is hosted at.

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '# Install the lighthouse CLI',
    '$ npm install -g lighthouse',
    '',
    '# Run the lighthouse CLI for your site',
    '$ npx lighthouse <url> --view',
  ]}
/>
