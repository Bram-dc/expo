The standard URL API is available on all Expo-supported platforms.

## Installation

This API is part of the `expo` package. Refer to the [browser and server runtime support](https://caniuse.com/textencoder) for web and Node.js.

## Usage

`TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder` are available globally without needing to import them.

```js
// [104, 101, 108, 111]
const hello = new TextEncoder().encode('hello');

// "hello"
const text = new TextDecoder().decode(hello);
```

## TextEncoder

The `TextEncoder` API is included in the Hermes engine.

## TextDecoder

The `TextDecoder` API is not spec compliant on native platforms. Only the `utf8` encoding is supported. If you need support for more encoding, use a polyfill like [`text-encoding`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/text-encoding).
